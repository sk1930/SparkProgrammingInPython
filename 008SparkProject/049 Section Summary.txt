049 Section Summary

Welcome Back. We successfully finished another section. Let me summarize what we learned. The following diagram is the main takeaway of this section. The figure gives you an overview of what is available to you and how they are arranged in the overall toolset. The recommendation is to use Spark SQL as and when possible. However, you will also need to use DataFrame to solve your data crunching problems. I briefly covered the RDD APIs and created an example so you can get some sense of it. However, you are going to avoid using RDDs. Finally, we learned to apply SQL over the DataFrames. I am assuming that you already know SQL, and this course is not about SQL. However, you already learned the basics of applying the SQL over the DataFrames. Then I talked about the Spark SQL engine and the catalyst optimizer. The optimization automatically works under the hood, and you don't have much to do there. However, it is good to know how things work. Great! That's all. See you in the next section. Keep Learning and Keep Growing.
